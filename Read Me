Hi, thanks for checking out my Points Rewards System!

This system is built to track the additions and spending of reward points from multiple vendors.
The system was designed using Java Spring and tested using postman.

I've made a few assumptions in creating this system:
    -A users points with any individual vendor cannot go negative. As such, a negative transaction that is larger than
    the balance with that vendor cannot be added.
    -Negative transactions added as a transaction (rather than spend) are immediately balanced out using available points
    from the same vendor
    -Transactions can only be added one at a time

You can test my system using the following calls, or by creating your own. Please note, in order to get the expected outcome
in the example, calls should be added in this order. The order is important as the negative transaction will balance out
using the current available balance. 

● { "payer": "DANNON", "points": 300, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T10:00:00Z" }
● { "payer": "MILLER COORS", "points": 10000, "timestamp": "2020-11-01T14:00:00Z" }
● { "payer": "DANNON", "points": -200, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T15:00:00Z" }
● { "payer": "UNILEVER", "points": 200, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T11:00:00Z"
● { "payer": "DANNON", "points": 1000, "timestamp": "2020-11-02T14:00:00Z" }
